            <p>This is the links page, here you can find links to all of my active social media pages and other related things.</p>

            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA4ygbOjhu66-Pax3xVAnPQ"><h2 style="text-align: center;">YouTube</h2></a>
            <hr/>
            <p>This is my Youtube page, I use this to upload random videos, originally I used this for edited content and memes, however I don't really do that anymore, so now if I ever end up uploading anything it will probably be related to modding and maybe edited video content rarely.</p>

            <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dookienookie/myworkshopfiles/"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Steam workshop</h2></a>
            <hr/>
            <p>This is my Steam Workshop. You can find some of the mods I have developed on this page for games that support it, Steam Workshop makes it more than easy to install addons and mods to games you already own, however it is also not very friendly towards developers so don't be surprised if my mods break on here randomly.</p>

            <a href="https://www.moddb.com/members/dazawassa"><h2 style="text-align: center;">ModDB</h2></a>
            <hr/>
            <p>This is my ModDB page, you will be able to find nearly every mod I have developed here, unlike GameBanana, ModDB has less strict guidelines, meaning it is easier to post mods on there when compared to GameBanana, do bare in mind I will also post on GameBanana whenever I can as I also enjoy that platform.</p>

            <a href="https://gamebanana.com/members/1585520"><h2 style="text-align: center;">GameBanana</h2></a>
            <hr/>
            <p>This is my GameBanana page, GameBanana is far more difficault to upload on as it has stricter guidelines for mods that are uploaded there, more of my mods will be on ModDB compared to gameBanana, however if you prefer this platform I will still upload there.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/ToothpasteHair"><h2 style="text-align: center;">GitHub</h2></a>
            <hr/>
            <p>This is my GitHub page, the dource code of my mods will be uploaded here, but along with that I will also upload the source code of other programs and apps I have been working on, so if any of those interest you then you should check this out.</p>
