            <br/> <!--After this break is a massive wall of text about me.-->
            <p>Hello, My name is jacqueline, I am a female computer programmer, musician and video game mod developer.</p>
            <p>You are most likley only here for the part about video game mod development, which you can find as many mods I have developed as I have been able to archive!</p>
            <p>I have been developing video game mods for an extremely long time now, it all originally began around 2010, this was about 3 years after I began using YouTube and began to view videos I ended up finding the modding community for the Halo games.</p>
            <p>To be more specific this was Halo Custom Edition, a sort of dev kit officially released by Gearbox software on Gamespy that allowed users to develop custom content for Halo, ranging from custom maps, guns literally anything. It allowed  for custom scripting, models, there was so much you could do with it.</p>
            <p>I eventually elected to learn how to make my own mods for this game, this is probably the reason why I am such a persistent person as this game was not intended to be modded and it really showed, the port was already held back die to it originally being an XBox game but it just made developing for it even more hard, as there were a large amount of things that indirectly would resault in issues with your mod.</p>
            <p>I made a few custom maps, these would use things such as custom <abbr title="Tags were a name used in game that refers to any entity in a map">tags</abbr> and map details.</p>
            <p>This then sent me down a rabbit hole in which I would then learn how to develop mods for other video games, such as Half-Life, Postal 2 and a large amount more, which you can find on this site by visiting the <a style="color: white;" href="download.htm">downloads page.</a></p>
            <p>From there I ended up getting into computer programming using languages such as C++ and Ruby, eventually leading me to where I am now, where I do a college course specifically for computers and am aiming for a job in that field, software I develop outside of modding may become available on this website later on but for now it is not.</p>
            <p>There are also links on this website to my active social medias, there you will be able to see things I am doing, these are mostly mod related but some of it is video related along with video content and possible other things.</p>
            <p>If you have any desire to contat me then you are more than welcome, you can visit my <a style="color: white;" href="contact.htm">contact page</a> in order to send me an email or possibally communicate with me in other ways, although as of the current time it is only email.</p>
            <p>If you have read this section, thank you very much because it means you have interest in my activites, I hope you continue to explore my site and enjoy the things I have created.</p>
